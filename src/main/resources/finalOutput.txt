I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out, baby 
I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out 

I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out, baby 
I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out, darlin' 

I'm beggin', you you 
Put your loving hand out, baby 
I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out, darlin' 

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own 
Just can't make it all alone 
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back 
I'm just a con about to fade to black 

Yeah 
I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out, baby 
I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out, darlin' 

But I keep walkin' on 
Keep rockin' dawns 
Keep walking forward 
Now the court is yours 
Keep browsin' halls 
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home 
Girl, I'm you 

You on a runway track from the good 
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could react 
Like the heart in a trash where you should 
You done gave it away 
Ya had it till you took it back 

What we doin'? What we chasin'? 
Why the bottom? Why the basement? 
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it? 
Why the feel for the need to replace me? 

A broken man 
But I don't know 
Won't even stand the devil's dance 
To win my soul 

An empty shell 
I used to be 
The shadow of my life 
Was hangin' over me 

I need you to understand 
Tried so hard to be your man 
The kind of man you want in the end 
Only then can I begin to live again 

I'm beggin', you you 
And put your loving hand out, baby 
I'm beggin', you you 
And put your loving hand out, darlin' 

I'm on my knees while I'm you 
'Cause I don't want to lose you 
Hey yeah, ratatata 

So, any time I need ya, let me go 
Yeah, any time I feed you, get me? No 
Any time I see you, let me know 
But I planted that seed, just let me grow 

Ridin' high when I was king 
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything 
I walked away, but you warned me then 
But easy come and easy go 
And it would end 

I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out, baby 
I'm beggin', you you 
So put your loving hand out, darlin' 

Put your loving hand out, baby 
'Cause I'm you
